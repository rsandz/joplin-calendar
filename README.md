# ‚öôÔ∏è Development

## Building the plugin

The plugin is built using Webpack, which creates the compiled code in `/dist`. A JPL archive will also be created at the root, which can be used to distribute the plugin or test locally by loading it into Joplin.

To build the plugin, simply run `npm run dist`.
Alternatively, to automatically rebuild the plugin on source code changes, run `npm run watch`

## Testing the plugin

Jest is used for unit tests. Run them with: `npm run test`.

## Updating the plugin framework

To update the plugin framework, run `npm run update`.

In general this command tries to do the right thing - in particular it's going to merge the changes in package.json and .gitignore instead of overwriting. It will also leave "/src" as well as README.md untouched.

The file that may cause problem is "webpack.config.js" because it's going to be overwritten. For that reason, if you want to change it, consider creating a separate JavaScript file and include it in webpack.config.js. That way, when you update, you only have to restore the line that include your file.
